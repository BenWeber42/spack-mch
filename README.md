# The Meteoschweiz Spack Deployment

Official Spack documentation [below](#-spack).

## Building software on tsa/daint

First git clone the Meteoschweiz spack configuration repository and install your own spack instance using the available config.sh script. Tell the script the machine you are working on using -m <machine> and where you want the instance to be installed using -i <spack-installation-directory>. You can also precise the spack version you want, or take the default value (last stable release).

    $ git clone git@github.com:MeteoSwiss-APN/spack-mch.git
    $ cd spack-mch
    $ ./config.sh -m <machine> -i <spack-installation-directory> -v <version> -r <repos.yaml-installation-directory>

For the cscs users, a spack instance for both tsa and daint will be maintained and installed under _/project/g110/spack/user/'machine'/spack_, so you can skip the previous step if you are not interested in the developement of our spack packages and config files.
	
Next and final installation step is to source the spack file under spack/share/spack in order to activate spack.

    $ . <spack-installation-directory>/share/spack/setup-env.sh
    $ (cscs users): . /project/g110/spack/user/<machine>/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
    
You are then able to build any packages available (_spack list_ to print the whole list of available packages)

    $ spack install <package>@<version>%<compiler> +<variants>
 
Ex:
    
    $ spack install cosmo@master%pgi cosmo_target=gpu
    

This will clone the package, build it and then install the chosen package and all its dependencies under _/scratch/$USER/install/tsa_ (see _config.yaml_ file section for details). The build-stage of your package and its dependencies are not kept (add _--keep-stage_ after the install command in order to keep it). Module files are also created during this process and installed under _/scratch/$USER/modules/_

## CSCS users: automatically source the correct spack instance when using bash

As said above, if you are not wanting to develop for the spack-mch you can just source the correct spack instance depending on the machine you are working on. Add those line to your .bashrc file if you want to do that automatically when opening a new terminal.

	$ case $(hostname -s) in
	$ 	tsa*|arolla*) export SPACK_ROOT=/project/g110/spack/user/tsa/spack ;;
	$ 	daint*) export SPACK_ROOT=/project/g110/spack/user/daint/spack ;;
	$ esac
	$ source $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh

## Dev-building software on tsa/daint

If you do not want to git clone the source of the package you want to install, especially if you are developing, you can use a local source in order to install your package. In order to do so, first go to the base directory of the package and then use spack _dev-build_ instead of spack install 
    
    $ cd <package_base_directory>
    $ spack dev-build <package>@<version>%<compiler> +<variants>
    
The package, its dependencies and its modules will be still installed under _/scratch/$USER/install/tsa_ & _/scratch/$USER/modules/_

## Spack info

Use the spack command

    $ spack info <package>
    
in order to get a list of all possible building configuration available such as: version available, list of dependencies and variants. Variants are a key-feature of spack since it tells it which build configuration we want (i.e COSMO with target gpu or cpu)

## Spack edit

Use the spack command

    $ spack edit <package>

in order to open the correspondig _package.py_ file and edit it directly

## Machine specific config files

Are available under _spack/etc/spack_. Their structure is:
<ul>
	<li>-compilers.yaml (all info about available compilers, machine specific compiler flags, module to load (PrgEnv) before compiling)</li>
	<li>-packages.yaml (all info about the already installed dependencies, i.e their module names or paths)</li>
	<li>-modules.yaml (all info about the created modules, i.e which env variable or modules should be set once loaded)</li>
	<li>-config.yaml (specifies the main installation path and the main module installation path, where to find thebinaries etc.)</li>
	<li>-upstreams.yaml (specifies where to find the pre-installed software, that are under /project/g110/spack-install/<machine> </li>
	<li>-repos.yaml (specifies where to find the only mch packages that are stored in spack-mch repository)</li>
</ul>

Spack is a multi-platform package manager that builds and installs
multiple versions and configurations of software. It works on Linux,
macOS, and many supercomputers. Spack is non-destructive: installing a
new version of a package does not break existing installations, so many
configurations of the same package can coexist.

Spack offers a simple "spec" syntax that allows users to specify versions
and configuration options. Package files are written in pure Python, and
specs allow package authors to write a single script for many different
builds of the same package.  With Spack, you can build your software
*all* the ways you want to.

See the
[Feature Overview](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html)
for examples and highlights.

To install spack and your first package, make sure you have Python.
Then:

    $ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
    $ cd spack/bin
    $ ./spack install zlib

Documentation
----------------

[**Full documentation**](http://spack.readthedocs.io/) is available, or
run `spack help` or `spack help --all`.

Tutorial
----------------

We maintain a
[**hands-on tutorial**](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).
It covers basic to advanced usage, packaging, developer features, and large HPC
deployments.  You can do all of the exercises on your own laptop using a
Docker container.

Feel free to use these materials to teach users at your organization
about Spack.

Contributing
------------------------
Contributing to Spack is relatively easy.  Just send us a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the
[Spack repository](https://github.com/spack/spack).

Your PR must pass Spack's unit tests and documentation tests, and must be
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant.  We enforce
these guidelines with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack).  To
run these tests locally, and for helpful tips on git, see our
[Contribution Guide](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).

Spack uses a rough approximation of the
[Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
branching model.  The ``develop`` branch contains the latest
contributions, and ``master`` is always tagged and points to the latest
stable release.
